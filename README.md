## \#\# The Problem

Traditional HR management in large defense organizations like the Indian Air Force (IAF) is often reactive. Critical data on personnel, training, and performance is siloed across disparate systems, making it incredibly difficult to predict outcomes like attrition or identify high-potential leaders early. This can impact workforce allocation, operational readiness, and overall efficiency.

-----

## \#\# Our Solution üí°

We have built a secure, two-part web application that serves as an AI-powered command center for IAF commanders. Our solution consists of:

1.  **A Robust Backend API**: Built with **Flask**, this server hosts two pre-trained **scikit-learn** models that analyze personnel data and serve predictions.
2.  **An Interactive Frontend Dashboard**: Built with **Streamlit**, this provides a user-friendly interface for commanders. With a single click, it sends data to the backend for analysis and visualizes the results in real-time.

Our models predict two key metrics for every individual:

  * **Attrition Risk** (High, Medium, Low)
  * **Leadership Potential** (High, Medium, Low)

-----

## \#\# Key Features ‚ú®

  * **Secure Login:** Ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
  * **Unified Dashboard:** Provides a single pane of glass for workforce analytics with KPIs and interactive charts.
  * **Real-time AI Predictions:** Instantly analyze the entire workforce to forecast attrition and leadership.
  * **Scalable Architecture:** The separation of frontend and backend allows for easy maintenance and future integration with other IAF systems.

-----

## \#\# Technical Architecture

Our project follows a modern, modular design for scalability and reliability.

  * **Frontend**: `Streamlit`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
  * **Backend**: `Flask`, `Scikit-learn`, `Joblib`
  * **Dataset**: `dataset.csv` (simulated personnel records)
  * **Models**: Two `RandomForestClassifier` models saved as `.pkl` files.

## \#\# How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * Anaconda or a virtual environment manager

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit flask pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

### Running the Application

You need to run the backend API and the frontend dashboard in **two separate terminals**.

**Terminal 1: Start the Backend API**

```bash
python app.py
```

*Your API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.*

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Dashboard**

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

*Your web application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.*

## \#\# Hackathon Impact

This project moves IAF human management from being **reactive to proactive**. By identifying attrition risks and future leaders early, our solution can:

  * **Save millions** in training costs by retaining talent.
  * **Improve command effectiveness** by nurturing a strong leadership pipeline.
  * **Enhance overall mission readiness** by ensuring the right personnel are in the right roles.
